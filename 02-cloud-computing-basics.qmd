# Cloud Computing Basics

We all need to start somewhere when we work with cloud computing. 

This chapter is meant to act as a refresher for how cloud computing works on the DNAnexus platform. If you haven't used cloud computing before, no worries! 

Also, if you are coming from using an on-premise high performance computing (HPC) cluster, you can skip ahead. 

## Learning Objectives

1. **Define** key players in both local computing and cloud computing
1. **Articulate** key differences between local computing and cloud computing
1. **Describe** the sequence of events in launching jobs in the DNAnexus cloud
1. **Differentiate** local storage from cloud-based project storage
1. **Describe** instance types and how to use them

## Important Terminology

- **DNAnexus Project** - contains files, executables (apps/applets), and logs associated with analysis. 
- **Software Environment** - everything needed to run a piece of software on a brand new computer. For example, this would include installing R, but also all of its dependencies as well. 
- **App/Applet** - Executable on the DNAnexus platform. 

## Understanding the key players

In order to understand what's going on with Cloud Computing, we will have to change our mental model of computing. 

Let's contrast the key players in local computing with the key players in cloud computing.

### Key Players in Local Computing

- Our Machine

When we run an analysis or process files on our computer, we are in control of all aspects of our computer. We are able to install a software environment, such as R or Python, and then execute scripts/notebooks that reside on our computer on data that's on our computer. 

### Key Players in High Performance Computing

- Our Machine
- Head Node
- HPC Worker
- Shared Storage

### Key Players in Cloud Computing

- Our Machine - We interact with the platform via the dx-toolkit installed on our machine.
- DNAnexus Platform - Although there are many parts, we can treat the DNAnexus platform as a single entity that we interact with. It takes our requests, requests worker machines, and then gives us responses. Also contains project storage.
- DNAnexus Worker - A temporary machine that comes from a pool of available machines.

## Key Differences

1. We don't own the worker machine, we only have temporary access to it.
2. We have to be explicit what kind of machine we want
