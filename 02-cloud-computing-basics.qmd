# Cloud Computing Basics

We all need to start somewhere when we work with cloud computing. 

This chapter is meant to act as a refresher for how cloud computing works on the DNAnexus platform. 

## Learning Objectives

1. **Define** key players in both local computing and cloud computing
1. **Articulate** key differences between local computing and cloud computing
1. **Describe** the sequence of events in launching jobs in the cloud
1. **Differentiate** local storage from cloud-based project storage
1. **Describe** instance types and how to use them

## Key Players

### Local Computing

- Our Machine
- Software Environment
- Our Disk

### Cloud Computing

- Our Machine
- DNAnexus Platform
- DNAnexus Worker

## Key Differences

1. We don't own the worker machine, we only have temporary access to it.
2. We have to be explicit
