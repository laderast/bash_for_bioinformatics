# UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform

## What's Different?

There are three main differences with UK Biobank and the Core DNAnexus Platform

1. You are limited to sharing within your own application ID.
2. The participant identifiers (`eid`s) are different across applications.
3. There is a `Bulk/` File Folder that contains many of the files you want to analyze.
