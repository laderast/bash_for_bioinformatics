# Shell Scripting Basics

## Learning Objectives

1. **Articulate** the three streams of a command line utility
2. **Wrap** executables and scripts in R/Python into a bash script.
3. **Utilize** *placeholder variables* and *arguments* to generalize our scripts
4. **Iterate** a script over a set of files using `xargs` or `for` loops

## Review of Bash scripting

We are going to cover Bash scripting, because it is the main shell that is available to us on DNAnexus machines, which are Ubuntu-based.

We will be using Bash scripts as "glue" for multiple applications in cloud computing, including:

1. **Wrapping scripts** in other languages so we can run them using `dx run` on a app such as Swiss Army Knife
2. **Specifying inputs and outputs** to executables in Applets/Workflows
3. Specifying inputs and outputs in a workflow built by Workflow Description Langugae (WDL).

As you can see, knowing Bash is extremely helpful when running jobs on the cloud.

## STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR

Every script has three streams available to it: Standard In (STDIN), Standard Out (STDOUT), and Standard Error (STDERR).
