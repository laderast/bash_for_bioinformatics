# Learning Objectives for this Book

This is a book that is meant to bring you (a budding bioinformaticist) beyond the foundational shell scripting skills learned from a shell scripting course such as [the one from the Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). Specifically, it shows you a path to get started with reproducible cloud computing on the DNAnexus platform. 

Our goal is to showcase the "glue" skills that help you do bioinformatics reproducibly. That includes:

- **Articulate** basic Cloud Computing concepts
- **Leverage** bash scripting and the dx-toolkit to execute jobs on the DNAnexus platform
- **Execute** batch processing of multiple files in a project on the DNAnexus platform
- **Build** and **Execute** applets on the DNAnexus platform by specifying JSON files
- **Implement** Portable Workflows using Workflow Description Language (WDL) to do the following:
    - Run on a single file
    - Batch process multiple files
    - Utilize multiple steps in a workflow
- **Utilize** `sed` and `awk` and other command line utilities to process files using regular expressions
- **Manage** software dependencies reproducibly using container-based technologies such as Docker
- **Utilize** Environment Variables in a reproducible way
- **Monitor**, **profile**, and **retry** jobs to optimize costs

## What is not covered

- Running and monitoring jobs on a HPC Cluster
- Running a workflow using Cromwell/MiniWDL

This book is not meant to be a substitute for excellent books such as [Data Science on the Command Line](). This book focuses on the essential shell skills (notably Bash) that will help you on the DNAnexus platform.

## Notes

This is a very opinionated journey through shell scripting, workflow languages, and reproduciblity. It is designed to build on each of the concepts in a gradual manner. 

At each step, you'll be able to do useful things with your data. We will focus on skills and programming patterns that are useful. 

## Prerequisites

Before you tackle this book, you should be able to accomplish the following:

- **Utilize** and **navigate** File Paths (both absolute and relative) in a Unix system
- **Articulate** the value of environment variables in shell scripting

We recommend reviewing a course such as the [Software Carpentry course for Shell Scripting](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) before getting started with this book.
