# Introduction

Bash scripting is an essential skill in bioinformatics that is often expected that bioinformaticians will just pickup in their careers. I think that this underestimates the difficulty of learning and applying Bash scripting. 

This is a book that is meant to bring you (a budding bioinformaticist) beyond the foundational shell scripting skills learned from a shell scripting course such as [the Software Carpentries Shell Course](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). 

Specifically, it shows you a path to get started with reproducible cloud computing on the DNAnexus platform. 

Our goal is to showcase the "glue" skills that help you do bioinformatics reproducibly. 

## Learning Objectives for this Book

After reading and doing the exercises in this book, you should be able to: 

- **Articulate** basic Cloud Computing concepts
- **Leverage** bash scripting and the dx-toolkit to execute jobs on the DNAnexus platform
- **Execute** batch processing of multiple files in a project on the DNAnexus platform
- **Monitor**, **profile**, and **retry** jobs to optimize costs
- **Manage** software dependencies reproducibly using container-based technologies such as Docker

## What is not covered

- Using Bash scripting in DNAnexus Apps and Workflows
- Using Bash Scripting in Workflow Description Language (WDL)
- Running and monitoring jobs on a HPC Cluster
- Running a workflow using Cromwell/MiniWDL

This book is not meant to be a substitute for excellent books such as [Data Science on the Command Line](https://datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/). This book focuses on the essential shell skills (notably Bash) that will help you on the DNAnexus platform.

## Notes

This is a very opinionated journey through Bash shell scripting, workflow languages, and reproduciblity. It is designed to build on each of the concepts in a gradual manner. Where possible, we link to the official DNAnexus documentation.

At each step, you'll be able to do useful things with your data. We will focus on skills and programming patterns that are useful. 

## Prerequisites

Before you tackle this book, you should be able to accomplish the following:

- **Utilize** and **navigate** File Paths (both absolute and relative) in a Unix system
- **Articulate** the importance of using environment variables (such as `PATH`) in shell scripting

We recommend reviewing a course such as the [Software Carpentry course for Shell Scripting](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) before getting started with this book.
