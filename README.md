# Bash for Bioinformatics

Bash scripting is an essential skill in bioinformatics that is often expected that bioinformaticians will just pickup in their careers. I think that this underestimates the difficulty of learning and applying Bash scripting. 

This is a book that is meant to bring you (a budding bioinformaticist) beyond the foundational shell scripting skills learned from a shell scripting course such as [the Software Carpentries Shell Course](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). 

Specifically, it shows you a path to get started with reproducible cloud computing on the DNAnexus platform. 

Our goal is to showcase the "glue" skills that help you do bioinformatics reproducibly. That includes:

- **Articulate** basic Cloud Computing concepts
- **Leverage** bash scripting and the dx-toolkit to execute jobs on the DNAnexus platform
- **Execute** batch processing of multiple files in a project on the DNAnexus platform
- **Monitor**, **profile**, and **retry** jobs to optimize costs
- **Manage** software dependencies reproducibly using container-based technologies such as Docker
