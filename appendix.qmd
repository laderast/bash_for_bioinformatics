## Environment Variables

### `$PATH`

The `$PATH` variable is one of the most important environment variables we'll set on your local machine. It specifies the directories where executables and binaries can be found. This is important when you install dx-toolkit to interact with the DNAnexus platform. 

In general, you want to append paths to the `$PATH` variable, rather than overwriting to it. This is because other processes may add to the `$PATH` variable as well, so you don't want to interfere with those processes. Adding to our `$PATH` variable depends on the different operating systems.

### Mac/Linux

The fastest way to add a directory to your path is to use the `export` command in your `.bash_profile`, or `.bashrc` file. For example, if the directory you want to add is `/opt/homebrew/bin/`, you'd edit your `.bash_profile` file and add the following line:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin/
```

Note that spacing matters in Bash scripting, especially in assigning variable names. 

### Other Environment Variables

We'll see that `dx-toolkit` defines a certain number of environmental variables and we can view them using `dx env`. These include:

- Current Project
- Current User
- Current Directory in Project
- API token used to access the platform
- etc.
