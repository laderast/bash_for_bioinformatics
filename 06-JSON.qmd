# Working with JSON on the Platform

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- **Define** and **Explain** what JSON is and structures
- **Explain** how JSON is used on the DNAnexus platform
- **Explain** the basic structure of a JSON file
- **Generate** JSON output from `dx find data` and `dx find jobs`
- **Execute** simple `jq` commands to extract information from a JSON file

## How is JSON used on the DNAnexus Platform?

JSON is used in multiple ways on the DNAnexus Platform, including:

- Submitting Jobs with complex parameters/inputs
- Specifying parameters of an app or workflow (`dxapp.json` and `dxworkflow.json`)
- Output of commands such as `dx find data` or `dx find jobs` with the `--json` flag
- Extracting environment variables from `dx env`

Underneath it all, all interactions with the DNAnexus API server are JSON submissions.

You can see that JSON is used in many places on the DNAnexus platforms, and for many purposes. So having basic knowledge of JSON can be really helpful.
