Specifically, it shows you a path to get started with reproducible cloud computing on the DNAnexus platform. Our goal is to showcase the “glue” skills that help you do bioinformatics reproducibly. That includes: Articulate basic Cloud Computing concepts Leverage bash scripting and the dx-toolkit to execute jobs on the DNAnexus platform Build and Execute applets on the DNAnexus platform by specifying JSON files Implement Portable Workflows using Workflow Description Language (WDL) to do the following: Run on a single file Batch process multiple files Utilize multiple steps in a workflow Utilize sed and awk and other command line utilities to process files using regular expressions Manage software dependencies reproducibly using container-based technologies such as Docker Utilize Environment Variables in a reproducible way Monitor, profile, and retry jobs to optimize costs 1.1 What is not covered Running and monitoring jobs on a HPC Cluster Running a workflow using Cromwell/MiniWDL This book is not meant to be a substitute for excellent books such as Data Science on the Command Line. This book focuses on the essential shell skills (notably Bash) that will help you on the DNAnexus platform. 1.2 Notes This is a very opinionated journey through shell scripting, workflow languages, and reproduciblity. It is designed to build on each of the concepts in a gradual manner. At each step, you’ll be able to do useful things with your data. We will focus on skills and programming patterns that are useful. 1.3 Prerequisites Before you tackle this book, you should be able to accomplish the following: Utilize and navigate File Paths (both absolute and relative) in a Unix system Utilize pipes and filters We recommend reviewing a course such as the Software Carpentry course for Shell Scripting before getting started with the course. 1.4 Setup for this section We’ll be running all of these scripts on our own machine. We’ll be using the command-line for most of these. If you are on Linux/Mac, you’ll be working with the terminal. If you are on Windows, I recommend you install Windows Subsystem for Linux, and specifically Ubuntu. That will give you a command-line shell that you can use to interact with the DNAnexus platform. sudo apt-get install python3 sudo apt-get install pip3 pip3 install dxpy That last command will install the dx-toolkit to your machine, which are the command line tools you’ll need to work on the DNAnexus cloud.
